Have you ever lost data because of not saving? I think everybody’s forgotten to save sometimes, and regretted it.

Why don’t we save more often? Maybe it’s because saving is really slow. This is particularly a problem in Microsoft Office, but it affects other apps like GraphicConverter as well. Writing a file to disk takes time, and the app stops you from making more edits while it’s saving.

A RAM disk is allows you to save much faster. But it’s more dangerous: if you computer shuts down before you copy the file off the RAM disk, there’s no backup. It’s as if you haven’t saved at all.

Enter RAMDisk Accelerator!

This app helps you create a RAM disk to meet your needs, and automatically backs up the files from it at periodic intervals. It makes saving files much faster in Word and other apps by making the save process run in the background.

Every 5 seconds, the app checks the MD5 hash of the RAM disk file, and the hard disk file. If they are different, the RAM disk file is copied to disk, replacing the file on the hard disk.

Try it now, and I’m sure you’ll notice your performance increase.
